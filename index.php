  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hello This is Vijaykumar Soshte,a Astrologer with more than 15 years of practice.Bring your problems to me I will solve them in a jiffy.</p>

<p>Intrepreted in all correctness,a knowledge of astrology doe afford mental strength to the feeble and the weak-minded,solace to the depressed,peace to the anxious and worried and steadiness to those who are wavering and vacillating in mind.It is a common experience that when troubles come,they come in battalions and the afflicted person gets solace from this knowledge that time is not far off when his or her trouble would cease to exist.</p>

<p>The knowledge of future prompts one to render help to those who are in need,banish evil thoughts from mind and make efforts to lead a simple honest and pious life.The saying "Do your duty with sincerity and leave the result to God" holds a more forceful appeal Astrology proves that failure and success depend on your previous Karma;sufferings are due to sins committed previously and this thought helps us to be good to society.
